## 🌟 Key Features

This project implements a collection of MODERN features and follows best practices for scalability and maintainability.

- **Type-Safe & Maintainable Codebase:**
  - Fully migrated to **TypeScript**, ensuring a robust, error-free, and highly maintainable codebase.
  - Centralized type definitions for API models, providing a single source of truth across the application.
- **Clean & Scalable Architecture:**
  - **Reusable Components:** Following the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle, the app uses generic components like `ContentGridPage` and `DetailPage` to render different types of content.
  - **Utility & Hooks Modules:** Helper functions and custom hooks are separated into dedicated directories for better organization.
- **Engaging Visual Effects:**
  - **3D Tilt Effect** on cards when hovered, created using `useRef` for optimal performance.
  - Smooth and fluid animations using the **Framer Motion** library.
  - **Glassmorphism** effect on the navigation bar that appears on scroll.
- **Advanced & Scalable Routing:**
  - A highly scalable routing structure using a single dynamic route (`/:mediaType/:id`) to handle detail pages for any content type.
- **Powerful Search:**
  - A full-screen search overlay.
  - Instant results using a custom `useDebounce` hook to optimize API requests.
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - **Lazy Loading** for cast images to increase initial page load speed.
  - **Skeleton Loaders** to improve the user experience while data is being fetched.
- **Enhanced UI Details:** Displays formatted vote counts (e.g., '1.2k', '1.5M') for better readability.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** A flawless viewing experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
